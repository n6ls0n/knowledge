### Unix

Assuming you already have your keys in your .ssh folder, use the following to stop having to type in the passphrase for that particular terminal session:

eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add

A more persistent and somehwat secure solution (PREFERRED):

Add this to your ~/.bashrc, then log out and back in to take effect.

if [ ! -S ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock ]; then
  eval `ssh-agent`
  ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
fi
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
ssh-add -l > /dev/null || ssh-add

This should only prompt for a password the first time you log in after each reboot. It will keep reusing the same ssh-agent as long as it's running.
